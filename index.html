		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Dirty soda, Spike Lee, white girl, Ice T
				Fully loaded AP, yeah</p>

			<p class="chorus">I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
				I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
				I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
				We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought
			</p>


			<p class="verse 1">Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
				You know I ain't scared to lose you
				They don't like it when you're telling the truth
				I'd rather be realer than you
				I had to make me a cot
				Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
				I sold the dope out your house
				Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
			</p>


			<p>You know I don't fuck with no rumors
				Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
				Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
				I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
				Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
				As for the xanny, I never forgot it
				Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
			</p>

			<p>Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
				'Cause there's too much too hide
				Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
				Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
				Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at
				Niggas know I ain't lying, niggas, know I ain't lying
			</p>


			<p>There's a lot on my mind, there's a lot on my plate
				But I never complain
				I was working the weight like I came out the gym
				I never did train
				Put the girl on a train
				Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy</p>


			<p class="chorus">I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
				I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
				I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
				We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought</p>


			<p class="chorus">I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
				I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
				I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
				We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought</p>


			<p>I strapped the dope to your spouse
				The first time I gave her an ounce
				I put some free bands in her account
				I told her, "Bitch, can't be running your mouth"
				Better watch what you say to these niggas
				'Cause you already know what they 'bout
				Put the game in a choke in a knot
				Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out</p>

			<p>Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
				I got some purp on me now
				Stacking the styrofoams up by the double
				They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
				Valet the whip by the front door
				On a Percocet now and I need me some more</p>


			<p>Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
				I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
				Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
				I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
				I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
				I float off the Earth in designer</p>


			<p>I'm working on having some manners
				I'm thinking about it right now
				I'm holding the cash while I pour up the lean
				Then I put one in the air</p>


			<p class="chorus">I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
				I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
				I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
				We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
			</p>


			<p class="chorus">I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops
				I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
				I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
				We got purple Activis, I thought it was a drought
			</p>


			<p>Thought it was a drought, thought it, thought it was a drought
				We thought it was a drought, we poured an Actavis
				Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
				You know I ain't scared to lose you
				They don't like it when you're telling the truth
				I'd rather be realer than you</p>
